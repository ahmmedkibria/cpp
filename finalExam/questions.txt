3. Problem Statement

You will be given data for N students, where each student will have a name (nm), class (cls), section (s) and student ID (id).

the section of the second student will be replaced by the section of the second last student and so on. 
See the sample input and output for more clarifications.

Input Format

First line will contain N.
Next N lines will contain nm, cls, s, and id respectively.
